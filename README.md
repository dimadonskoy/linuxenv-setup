## üìú Scripts Overview

### 1. **global_env_script.sh**
   - Installs essential applications and dependencies for the environment.
   - Designed to be executed during the provisioning process.
   ### 2. **user_env_script.sh**

   - Configures user-specific settings and preferences.
   - Tailored for customizing the environment of a specific user after the global setup.
   - Should be run as the target user to apply configurations such as shell preferences, aliases, and environment variables.
   - Useful for personalizing the development environment or applying user-level tweaks.
   - Can be executed manually after provisioning is complete.  - Configures user-specific settings and preferences.
   - Tailored for the user whose environment needs customization.

### 3. **create_user_script.sh** *(Optional)*
   - Creates a new user in Ubuntu.
   - Ideal for scenarios where additional user accounts are required.
